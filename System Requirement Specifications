## 1. Introduction
#  1.1 Purpose
      The purpose of the Software Requirement Specifications document is to describe the functions our software, the MusicXML previewing system will be able to perform and how exactly our software will be able to achieve the desired results. 
#  1.2 Intended Audience
       This document is intended for:
       - Customer/Client: The customer or client will be expressing what features they would like the software to have, and through this document ensure that the software will cover the aspects they would like. 
       - Project Manager: The project manager will be a point of contact for any conveyance between the developers and the customer/client and communicate any new demands or changes in the customer/client’s requirements. The project manager will also be setting deadlines for the developers to follow and assist in maximizing developer efficiency. 
       - Developers: The developers will be working on implementing the requirements of this software as laid out by the customer/client through their development of the software.
 
1.3 Intended Use
The software development timeline of the project is from January 10, 2022 to April 11, 2022. The main costs involved in this project are time, energy, and electricity. The software’s ability to perform the required tasks will be the measure of success. Our team has determined the core features/functionality, important features, and nonfunctional requirements to be the deliverables of this project. Risk will be evaluated by grading it’s exposure, probability of occurrence, and loss size (in days). Based on the context and severity of the risk, effective mitigation measures will be implemented. 

2.  Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective 
This software package (application) will be accessed when run through Eclipse. The application will connect to the user interface of MusicXML Converter.
